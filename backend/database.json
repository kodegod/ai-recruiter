I currently work as a front-end engineer at Hacker Rank and I have six years of experience. I have worked on Angular and React frameworks in the past and I am glad to be interviewing with Google. Thank you."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Nice to meet you, Abelash! Thank you for introducing yourself. I'm excited to learn more about your experience and qualifications for the Frontend Engineer role here at Google. Just a minor correction, though - we're not actually conducting the interview on behalf of Google, but rather as a simulation to assess your fit for a Frontend Engineer position.\n\nLet's dive right in! With six years of experience in front-end engineering, I'm sure you have a wealth of knowledge to share. Can you tell me about a particularly challenging project you worked on at Hacker Rank? What was the problem you were trying to solve, and how did you approach it?"}, {"role": "user", "content": " So, the problem that I've worked on are I built an AI powered recruiter, which basically worked like this. If you are a candidate, you could record your audio and the recruiter would respond again with an audio message and I was the lead engineer on this. I made use of Generative AI technologies to build this application. That's just one of the recent projects that I have worked. on."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That sounds like a fascinating project, Abelash! Building an AI-powered recruiter that can respond to candidates with audio messages is a complex task. I'd love to hear more about your experience with Generative AI technologies.\n\nCan you elaborate on how you integrated Generative AI into the application? What specific technologies or libraries did you use, and what kind of challenges did you face while implementing them? For example, how did you ensure the recruiter's audio responses were accurate and relevant to the candidate's input?\n\nAlso, as the lead engineer on this project, what was your approach to overseeing the development process, and how did you collaborate with your team members to bring this project to life?"}, {"role": "user", "content": " Thanks. What I did was I made use of GROC API and 11 Labs. So the GROC API used to convert my speech to text and the 11 Labs API converted text to speech. So basically GROC API was used to convert the candidate response and then the 11 Labs API was used to convert the text response that I was getting from LLM back into speech and convey it to the candidate as a response. Those were the major technologies that I used."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So, you leveraged the GROC API for speech-to-text conversion and the 11 Labs API for text-to-speech conversion to create a seamless interaction between the candidate and the AI-powered recruiter. That's a clever approach!\n\nI'm curious, how did you handle the latency and response time between the candidate's audio input, the speech-to-text conversion, and the subsequent text-to-speech conversion? Were there any specific optimizations you made to ensure the conversation felt natural and didn't lag too much?\n\nAdditionally, since you were working with Large Language Models (LLMs), how did you fine-tune the model to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses to the candidates? Did you have to create custom training datasets or use existing ones?"}, {"role": "user", "content": " I did not make use of any fine tuning but what I basically did was just make use of the APs that were available out of the box to create this application. The latency was definitely an issue because the recruiter used to take a lot of time to come back with the response and we were thinking of fine tuning it so that the responses were sent back. sooner but that's a problem statement that we're still working on and we haven't found a solution to it"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So, you used the APIs as-is, without fine-tuning the models, to create the application. That's a good approach to get a proof-of-concept up and running quickly.\n\nRegarding the latency issue, it's not uncommon when working with conversational AI applications. It's great that you're aware of it and are thinking of ways to optimize the response time. Fine-tuning the models can definitely help improve the performance, but it's not a trivial task.\n\nCan you tell me more about what you're thinking in terms of optimizing the response time? Are you considering using caching mechanisms, optimizing the API calls, or exploring other architectures that can help reduce the latency?\n\nAlso, since you mentioned that the latency is still an open problem, how do you approach problem-solving in general? Can you walk me through your thought process when you're faced with a complex technical challenge like this one?"}, {"role": "user", "content": " Hi, my name is Abinash.

I'd be happy to learn more about your background and experience as a front-end developer."}, {"role": "user", "content": " Sure, I guess I'm the same candidate, Avilaj from before.

We had a great conversation earlier, and I think you meant to say Abelash, not Avilaj or Abinash. Don't worry, it can happen to anyone!\n\nLet's pick up where we left off. We were discussing your project, the AI-powered recruiter that takes a video response from the candidate and outputs an audio response from the recruiter. You mentioned using GROC API for speech-to-text conversion and 11 Labs API for text-to-speech conversion.\n\nTo continue, I was asking about your approach to problem-solving and how you handle complex technical challenges like the latency issue we discussed earlier.

Let's try to get back on track!\n\nTo clarify, I was asking about your approach to problem-solving, particularly when faced with complex technical challenges like the latency issue we discussed earlier in our conversation about the AI-powered recruiter project.\n\nCould you please try to rephrase or complete your response? For example, you might share your thought process when approaching a difficult problem, any specific strategies or tools you use to break down complex issues, or any best practices you've learned from your experience as a frontend engineer.\n\nI'm here to listen and help you feel comfortable sharing your thoughts, so take your time and feel free to ask for clarification if you need it!"}, {"role": "user", "content": " I think I like my name is this.

While it's interesting to hear about your hobbies and personal growth strategies, I'd like to bring the conversation back to the topic at hand.\n\nAs a frontend engineer, problem-solving is a crucial skill. I'm still curious to know more about your approach to tackling complex technical challenges. Could you try to relate your problem-solving strategies to a specific project or experience you've had in your frontend engineering role?\n\nFor example, you could share an instance where you encountered a tricky bug, and how you went about debugging and resolving it. Or perhaps you could walk me through your thought process when approaching a new project or feature implementation.\n\nLet's try to focus on the technical aspects of frontend engineering and how you apply your skills to overcome challenges."}, {"role": "user", "content": " Sure, let me talk about that. So basically I first breakdowns and the problems and once that is done, I pick up each sub-problem and for each of the sub-problems, I try to come up with the solution and that's how I typically approach any problems or work."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So, you follow a structured approach to problem-solving, which involves breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable sub-problems, and then tackling each sub-problem individually to come up with a solution. This is a great strategy, and it's often referred to as \"divide and conquer\".\n\nBy breaking down the problem into smaller pieces, you can more easily identify the root causes of the issue, and then create a plan to address each sub-problem. This approach can help you stay focused, avoid feeling overwhelmed, and make progress towards finding a solution.\n\nCan you tell me more about how you determine which sub-problems to tackle first? Do you prioritize them based on their complexity, their impact on the overall problem, or something else?\n\nAlso, how do you ensure that your solutions to the sub-problems are aligned with the overall goal of solving the original problem? In other words, how do you keep the big picture in mind while focusing on the smaller details?"}, {"role": "user", "content": " The"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It seems like you started to respond, but it got cut off.
